# Yebis

## Introduction

Yebis allows you to predict a metric called "Investment Score".

The Investment Score ranges from +10 to -10.

If the Investment Score is 10, it *might* tell us that economic conditions around the world are favorable for investing in stocks, bonds, and commodities.

If the score is -10, it *might* tell us that economic conditions are not suitable for investing.

The Investment Score is calculated from several types of economic metrics, such as FEDFUNDS RATE, US10Y, and so on.

## How to use

Set an enviroment variable called "YEBIS_API_KEY" to your FRD API key like this:

```
export FED_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```
